## Haskell Interpreter - OneLiner
This is an interpreter for working on infinite data streams.

> Streams are potentially unbounded sequences of data. They are common in mathematics, computer science and everyday life. Examples of streams include streaming a movie on the web, a sequence of bits flowing through a wire in a digital circuit, or temperature measurements outside of Building 53 taken every hour. The theory of (discrete) signal processing deals with infinite sequences of reals. Similarly, in computer science, dataflow is the study of networks of nodes and channels through which a potentially unbounded number of data elements flow.

## Syntax
The grammar consists of:
- <kbd>App</kbd> - contains all the <kbd>Prog</kbd>rams in an application. 
- <kbd>Prefix/Suffix</kbd> - can be added before and/or after an <kbd>App</kbd>lication.
- <kbd>Prog</kbd> - where the functions that will be applied to the **Stream** are  defined.
